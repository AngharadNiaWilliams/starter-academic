summary: Special Interest Meeting in Autobiographical Memory and Psychopathology, MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit  
abstract: "Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence suggests that the ability to vividly remember our personal past, and imagine future scenarios, involves two closely connected regions: the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Despite evidence of a direct anatomical connection from anterior hippocampus to vmPFC, formed via the fornix, it is unknown whether hippocampal-vmPFC structural connectivity supports both past and future-oriented episodic thinking. To
address this, we applied diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and a novel
deterministic tractography protocol to reconstruct distinct subdivisions of the fornix previously detected in axonal tracer studies, namely pre-commissural (connecting the anterior hippocampus to vmPFC) and post-commissural (linking the posterior hippocampus and medial diencephalon) fornix, in a group of healthy individuals who undertook an adapted past-future autobiographical interview. As predicted, we found that inter-individual differences in pre-commissural - but not post-commissural - fornix microstructure (fractional anisotropy) was significantly correlated with the episodic richness of both past
and future autobiographical narratives. Notably, these results remained significant when controlling for both non-episodic narrative content and grey matter volumes of the hippocampus and vmPFC. This study provides novel evidence that reconstructing events from oneâ€™s personal past, and constructing possible future events, involves a distinct, structurally-instantiated hippocampal-vmPFC pathway."
