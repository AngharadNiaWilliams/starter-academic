abstract: 'Event-related potential (ERP) signatures of preparation to retrieve episodic memories have been identified in several studies. A common finding is relatively more positive-going ERP activity over right-frontal sites when people prepare for episodic rather than semantic retrieval. This activity has been linked to the process of retrieval mode â€“ a retrieval set that ensures subsequent events are treated as cues for episodic retrieval. This experiment was designed to test one explanation for why this putative index of retrieval mode was not observed in two recent experiments. Towards this end, ERPs were recorded time-locked to different task-cues indicating which of two retrieval tasks participants should prepare to complete. Each task-cue was followed by a retrieval-cue that required a memory judgment. Departures from the designs of the two studies in which null ERP results were obtained were intra-trial timings and the order in which task cues were presented. Frequentist statistics revealed that ERPs elicited by the task-cues did index preparation to retrieve. The topographies of these activities, however, did not overlap markedly with that of the putative index of retrieval mode reported previously. Bayesian analyses, moreover, provided little compelling evidence for a signature of retrieval mode. These outcomes prompt consideration of how ERP sensitivities to preparatory retrieval processing should be characterized.'
