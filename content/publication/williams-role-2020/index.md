abstract: "Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence suggests\
  \ that the ability to vividly remember our personal past, and imagine future scenarios,\
  \ involves two closely connected regions: the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal\
  \ cortex (vmPFC). Despite evidence of a direct anatomical connection from hippocampus\
  \ to vmPFC, it is unknown whether hippocampal-vmPFC structural connectivity supports\
  \ both past- and future-oriented episodic thinking. To address this, we applied\
  \ a novel deterministic tractography protocol to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging\
  \ (dMRI) data from a group of healthy young adult humans who undertook an adapted\
  \ past-future autobiographical interview (portions of this data were published in\
  \ Hodgetts et al., 2017a). This tractography protocol enabled distinct subdivisions\
  \ of the fornix, detected previously in axonal tracer studies, to be reconstructed\
  \ in vivo, namely the pre-commissural (connecting the hippocampus to vmPFC) and\
  \ post-commissural (linking the hippocampus and medial diencephalon) fornix. As\
  \ predicted, we found that inter-individual differences in pre-commissural - but\
  \ not post-commissural - fornix microstructure (fractional anisotropy) were significantly\
  \ correlated with the episodic richness of both past and future autobiographical\
  \ narratives. Notably, these results held when controlling for non-episodic narrative\
  \ content, verbal fluency, and grey matter volumes of the hippocampus and vmPFC.\
  \ This study provides novel evidence that reconstructing events from one's personal\
  \ past, and constructing possible future events, involves a distinct, structurally-instantiated\
  \ hippocampal-vmPFC pathway."
